# chirpy-mvc

Chirpy retrieves data from and posts user messages to a database using the mvc design pattern. 

It is built with node, express, mysql, jquery and bootstrap.

My main challenge was creating the routes to the server and using jquery to read and display server data, as well as create objects to post to the server.

Dependencies include express, mysql, and moment.
